# Conditional Statements in Python: Program to Check Whether a Number is Divisible by Both 11 and 3 Using if-else

## Aim
To write a Python program to check whether a given number is divisible by both 11 and 4 using if-else statement.

## Algorithm
1.  Start the program.
2.  Read an integer from the user.
3.  Check the conditions:
    If the number is divisible by both 11 and 4 (num % 11 == 0 and num % 4 == 0)
    Print that the number is divisible by both 11 and 4.
    Else
    Print that the number is NOT divisible by both 11 and 4.
4.  Stop the program.

## Program
```
num = int(input())

if num % 11 == 0 and num % 4 == 0:
    print(f"{num} is divisible by both 11 and 4")
else:
    print(f"{num} is NOT divisible by both 11 and 4")

```
